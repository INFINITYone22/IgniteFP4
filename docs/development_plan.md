# Development Plan: IgniteFP4

**Core Vision:** To create an open-source Python framework, "IgniteFP4," that provides researchers and practitioners with user-friendly tools, state-of-the-art algorithms, and highly optimized kernels for training and deploying deep learning models using FP4 precision on upcoming capable hardware.

**Guiding Principles:**
1.  **Ease of Use:** Abstract away the complexities of FP4, making it accessible.
2.  **State-of-the-Art:** Incorporate the latest and most effective FP4 quantization and training methodologies.
3.  **Performance:** Target near-native speed by leveraging hardware FP4 capabilities.
4.  **Modularity & Extensibility:** Allow easy integration of new algorithms, models, and hardware backends.
5.  **PyTorch-First (Initially):** Leverage PyTorch's ecosystem and flexibility for initial development, with an eye towards broader compatibility later.
